App Overview
------------
The Touch Notifier Companion App is a simple app that receives
data wirelessly and notifies a user if the
[Touch Sensor](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/sensor/grove-buzzer)
is being touched.

The Touch Notifier node.js/IoT project sends this data to a
connected client when running on a IoT platform such as a
development board with the sensor connected. This sensor is
included in the Grove Starter Kit Plus - Intel® IoT Edition.
